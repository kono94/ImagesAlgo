Thoughgs:

1) Inner classes or seperated classes?
	- possible inner classes [view]: 
		- MyMenuBar, ImageBarPanel, (MyFileChooser), 
		- whats up with "MyImage" ?

2) MVC-Pattern
	-	apply all Listeners in controller
	-	view knows controller
	
	
3) Observer-Pattern
	-	between Model and View
	
4) JFileChooser
	-	pass model and call "model.addImageToVector" OR pass the vector itself (JFileChooser changes model-data :/ )
	-	same for view
